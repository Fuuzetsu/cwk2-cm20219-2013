‘cabal configure && cabal build’ to build the project.
Might need to ‘cabal install --only-dependencies’ first. The binary should
be at dist/build/cubeviewer. Tested with GHC 7.6.3.

Left mouse button rotates the camera around the cube.
Right mouse button zooms in and out. Use mouse wheel for smaller increments.

Switch focus point using middle mouse button or pressing 'n'. The
focus points are the middle of the scene and the cube vertices.

You can press 'r' at any time to reset the camera to initial position.

Press 'q' to quit.
